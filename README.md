# Update Param Groups
iLogic script to update parameter groups automatically.

This script automatically creates and deletes parameter groups based on the presence of 'group' prefixes added to parameter names, in the format `group:parameterName`, where `:` is used as the default of what could be any predefined string.

The intention is hopefully to make parameter groups possible and easy to manage.
